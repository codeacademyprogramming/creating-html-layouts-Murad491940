    <li>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (About this soundlisten); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time.</li>
    <li>Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</li>
    <li>Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.</li>
    <li>His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".</li>
    <li>His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.</li>
    <li>He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</li>
    <li>His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".</li>
